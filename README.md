# EPLA Generation Tool
Hello! I am Evan Kawabata. Welcome to the code behind my EPLA Generation Tool.
I completed this project as a graduation requirement for my undergraduate degree at Webb Institute.
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me at ekawabata24@webb.edu.

## Requirements
This thesis was completed using VBA within Microsoft Excel. My design tool was created using Excel Version 2404 (Build 17531.20140) but the exact version probably does not matter much.
I did not reference any other software specifically for my design tool, however I did reference external packages for Hunt & Koziol's tool.
See this link for their github project. https://github.com/alekoz47/electrical-systems-model

In order to access VBA within Microsoft Excel, you may need the Developer tab. Access this by right-clicking on the ribbon, select "Customize the Ribbon..." and check the Developer tab.
In the Developer tab, click "Visual Basic" or use alt+F11 to enter the VBA IDE.
I created separate modules for each core functionality behind the code. I had the `main`, `calculations`, and `sheet_manip` modules. I used a class module called `location_node` to define the location_node object.

## Usage
